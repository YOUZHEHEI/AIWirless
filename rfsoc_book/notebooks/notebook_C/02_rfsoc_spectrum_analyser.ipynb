        "The Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC contains high frequency samplers known as RF Data Converters (RF DCs). The RF DCs are tightly coupled with the Programmable Logic (PL), creating a high-throughput, low-latency path between the FPGA and analogue world. The RFSoC Spectrum Analyser Module (RFSoC-SAM) [1] employs the RF Analogue-to-Digital Converters (RF ADCs) to receive RF time domain signals. The received data is manipulated using spectral pre-processing techniques in the PL, to prepare it for frequency domain analysis and visualisation in the Processing System (PS).\n",
        "\n",
        "A significant portion of the design has been implemented in the RFSoC's PL to prevent the PS from applying highly computational arithmetic. There is a spectrum analyser for each available RF ADC channel in the design. The spectrum Analysers are also interfaced to their very own flexible decimator, allowing different sample rates to be configured for each channel.\n",
