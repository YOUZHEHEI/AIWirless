We will begin by introducing the sampling process and explore sample rates used by different applications. Then we will investigate the effect of sampling a \"continuous\" waveform at different sampling frequencies and observe the effects of slow, fast, and reasonable sampling. Finally, the Nyquist sampling theorem will be introduced and the effects of aliasing discussed.\n",

This sample is assigned a binary number through a process called quantisation - more on that later.
